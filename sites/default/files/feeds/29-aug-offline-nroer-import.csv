The stupa and its allied buildings serve as a monument to commemorate the life and teaching of the Buddha and the great Buddhist teachers. The stone gateways mark the cardinal directions and are profusely carved with scenes from the life of the Buddha and motifs associated with Buddhism - the wheel, column, bodhi tree, footprints and the trident. In this picture, one sees the top portion of the west pillar of the southern gateway. The Dharmachakra, the wheel signifying moral codes of conduct, crowns a column. Members of a royal family are seen paying homage to the Dharmachakra. In the lower panel, a king accompanied by his wife on a chariot is shown. The sculptures on the gateways provide information on the customs, costumes and rituals of that period.

The exquisite marble screens, carved in duplicate geometric patterns are some important architectural features of this small jewel-like tomb of the saint. At the tomb, the inside inlay work using different kinds of stones and lapis lazuli provides a brilliant contrast to the marble. The tomb is the only building which is made out of white marble in the entire complex. The original structure in red sandstone was changed to white marble either during Jahangir’s or early period of Shahjahan’s reign. Visitors to this tomb pray to the Saint for his blessings. They tie threads on the doorway with a promise to return to the tomb after fulfillment of their desires.

public://resources/architectureofdelhi20.jpg,"Hanuman Mandir, New Delhi",,CR,,"This is the image of sacred Hindu temple 'Hanuman Mandir' at Baba Kharak Singh Marg. The Hanuman Mandir has its interiors made of smooth white marble. The exteriors were renovated in the year 1964 A.D. The interior walls are partly covered with silver. The other idols of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita are also covered with silver ornamentation. The idol of the chief God Hanuman, is believed to have been found during the medieval period. The surging crowds that pour into the temple, do so under a popular religious theory which classifies the temple as a Siddha Peeth (a place of fulfillment of wishes).  Today, a whole range of shops surrounding the temple have marred its original architectural beauty.

The magnificent structure which looks like a half open lotus bud, the symbol of worship, creation, beauty and Purity has its nine exterior petals in glistening white marble. The nine outer leaves form a canopy over the nine wooden panelled entrances to the temple. The smooth white marble flooring inside the auditorium creates a beautiful atmosphere where the people from all faiths can pray in silence. Around the temple are walkways and stairs which surround the nine pools, representing the floating leaves of the lotus. The pools of water help in cooling the building. It is one of the seven Baha‘i Houses of worship in the World.

It has three entrance doorways facing the east, north and the south. In contrast to the exterior which is relatively plain, the interior is elaborately carved, and one sees some insertions of white marble. The elaborate carvings comprise extracts from the Koran in Kufic and Naskh characters. Originally, the dome rested on the top of the rectangular hall which has collapsed.

It was started by Alaud-Din Khalji. It is said that he conceived the minar to be double the height of the present Qutub Minar. However, with its extant height of 24.5 meters, it had hardly reached its first storey when he died leaving it incomplete. After the death of Alaud-Din Khalji, his successors could not complete the ambitious task. Today, its skeleton stands like a mute witness to the aspirations of the great emperor.
